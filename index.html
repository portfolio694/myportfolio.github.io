            <h3>Deep Learning-Based System for Crop Pest and Weed Identification</h3>
            <p>Vision Transformer (ViT)-Based Deep Learning for Plant Health Classification</p>
            
                In precision agriculture, timely and accurate identification of pests and weeds is critical for maximizing crop productivity and minimizing economic losses. Traditional methods like manual inspection or rule-based image analysis are often labor-intensive, slow, and prone to human error.
                To address these challenges, I developed a deep learning solution leveraging a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for classifying plant images into categories such as pest-infected, weed-dominated, and healthy crops. Using a pretrained ViT-Base-16 model, I fine-tuned it on a labeled dataset with comprehensive data augmentation techniques—including color jitter, Gaussian blur, and random rotation—to enhance model robustness and generalization.
                The dataset was split 80/20 for training and testing, and the model was trained using the Hugging Face Trainer API with carefully optimized hyperparameters. The final model achieved a test accuracy of 91.77%, outperforming traditional and shallow-learning approaches.
                Unlike hardware-intensive alternatives, this ViT-based solution is cost-effective, scalable, and maintenance-free, enabling real-time plant health monitoring. This work demonstrates strong potential for integration into smart farming platforms, empowering farmers and agronomists with automated, data-driven decision-making tools—contributing to more sustainable and efficient agricultural practices.
